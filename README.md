ASSIGNMENT 1

Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
This section performs four mathematical operations on two integers provided by the user.

It prompts the user to input two integers (a and b).

It calculates:

a1 = a + b → Addition

a2 = a - b → Subtraction

a3 = a * b → Multiplication

a4 = a // b → Integer Division (division without decimals)

It prints the result of each operation 

 Task 2: Greeting Message
This part of the code creates a personalized greeting.

It prompts the user to enter their first and last name.

It concatenates the names with a space between.

It prints a greeting message


ASSIGNMENT 2

 Task 1: Check Whether a Number is Odd or Even

The user is prompted to input an integer.

The program checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%):

If a % 2 == 0, it means the number is divisible by 2 → it's even.

Otherwise, it's odd.

It then prints a message indicating the result. 

Task 2: Sum of the First 50 Natural Numbers

It initializes a variable sum = 0.

It uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

Each number is added to the running total sum.

After the loop finishes, it prints the total sum.


ASSIGNMENT 3

Task 1: Factorial of a Number (Using Recursion)

A function factorial(n) is defined using recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.

If n is 0 or 1, it returns 1 (base case).

Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and multiplies the result by n.

The user is prompted to enter a number.

If the number is negative, it prints an error message.

If the number is 0 or positive, it computes the factorial and displays the result.

Task 2: Math Operations Using math Module

The program prompts the user to enter a positive number.

It uses a try-except block to handle invalid (non-numeric) input gracefully.

If the number is greater than 0, it calculates:

math.sqrt(number) → Square Root

math.log(number) → Natural Logarithm (ln)

math.sin(number) → Sine, using the input as radians

It prints all the computed values in a clear, labeled format.

If the number is 0 or negative, it displays a warning message.
